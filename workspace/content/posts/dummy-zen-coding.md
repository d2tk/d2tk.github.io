# Complexity is the Enemy

We spend so much time building abstractions that we often forget what we are buildings things *for*. The goal of software engineering is not to write code; it is to **solve problems**.

## The Art of Subtraction

Every line of code you write is a liability. It has to be read, understood, tested, and maintained. The best engineers determine what *not* to build.

1.  **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**: Do not implement features for a hypothetical future.
2.  **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Simple systems fail less often.
3.  **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: But be careful not to couple things that are coincidentally similar but conceptually different.

## Walking Away

Sometimes the best debugging tool is a walk outside.

We must strive for simplicity, even when (especially when) the problem is complex.
